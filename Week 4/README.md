# 💰 Personal Finance Tracker (Week 4 Final Project)

A **menu-driven Personal Finance Tracker** built using **Python file handling, modular programming, and error handling**.  
This project helps users **record, store, analyze, and manage expenses** with persistent data storage using **JSON and CSV files**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Managing personal expenses manually can be difficult and error-prone.  
This project provides a **simple command-line application** that allows users to:

- Add daily expenses
- Categorize spending
- Store data permanently using files
- Generate expense reports
- Export data for further analysis
- Create backups for data safety

The project demonstrates **real-world usage of Python file handling concepts** taught in Weeks 1–4.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand file operations in Python
- Implement data persistence using JSON and CSV
- Practice modular programming
- Handle file-related errors gracefully
- Build a real-world, end-to-end application
- Improve debugging and testing skills

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **File Formats:** JSON, CSV  
- **Concepts:**  
  - File Handling  
  - Context Managers (`with` statement)  
  - Exception Handling  
  - Object-Oriented Programming  
  - Modular Code Structure
